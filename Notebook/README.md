# 📓 Notebooks for Supply Chain Analysis

This folder contains Jupyter/Colab notebooks used for:

- 🔍 Data cleaning and transformation
- 📈 Predictive modeling
- 📊 Exporting results for Power BI

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter.
2. Mount Azure Blob or upload dataset manually.
3. Run each cell in order.
4. Export final output as cleaned_data.csv for Power BI use.

This folder contains all Jupyter/Colab notebooks used for:
- ✅ Data cleaning and transformation (completed in Colab)
- ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in exploratoryDataAnalysis.ipynb
- 🔜 Predictive modeling (to be added in model.ipynb)
- 🔜 Exporting predictions for Power BI dashboard

## 📂 Contents
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| exploratoryDataAnalysis.ipynb | Contains all EDA plots, correlation heatmaps, customer segments, shipping trends |
| model.ipynb | *(Coming soon)* Predictive model to forecast delivery delays / demand |
| requirements.txt | *(Optional)* Libraries to run locally |

## 🚀 Next Steps
- You (leader) will build model.ipynb to predict delays or demand.
- Predictions will be saved as predictions.csv for Power BI.
