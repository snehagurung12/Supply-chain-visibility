# ðŸ§¾ Project Report â€” Supply Chain Visibility & Predictive Analysis

## Chapter 1: Introduction
This project simulates a modern data-driven supply chain analytics platform built using cost-free tools to replicate Azure Cloud capabilities.

## Problem Statement
Lack of transparency and prediction in traditional supply chain processes causes delays, inefficiency, and poor decision-making.

## Objectives
1. Enhance supply chain visibility  
2. Predict shipment delays and demand  
3. Visualize performance metrics using Power BI  
4. Design scalable architecture for future Azure deployment  

## Methodology
- **Data Source:** Synthetic CSVs uploaded to GitHub  
- **ETL:** Pandas-based cleaning in Colab  
- **Modeling:** Random Forest, Decision Tree  
- **Visualization:** Power BI interactive dashboard  

## Expected Outcome
- Clear insight into logistics performance  
- Predictive analytics capability  
- Ready-to-migrate Azure blueprint  

## Tools Used
- Google Colab, Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn)  
- Power BI Desktop  
- GitHub for versioning  

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates end-to-end visibility and forecasting in a supply chain pipeline using free tools, providing a strong foundation for Azure migration.
