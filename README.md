# Supply Chain Visibility & Predictive Analysis

## 🔍 Objective
This project aims to simulate a supply chain analytics system using Azure architecture (Blob Storage, Data Factory, Synapse) and build actionable dashboards using Power BI.

## 👤 Roles
- *Azure Solution Architect (Sneha Gurung)*: Designed the cloud pipeline, simulated Synapse analytics in Python
- *Data Analyst (Srishti Poudel)*: Created Power BI dashboards and extracted insights

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Google Colab (for data cleaning)
- Azure Synapse (simulated)
- Power BI
- GitHub

## 📁 Structure
- /data – datasets
- /notebooks – Colab notebooks
- /architecture – Azure diagram and design
- /powerbi – dashboards
- /documentation – findings and summaries

## 🧩 Architecture Diagram

This diagram illustrates how raw supply chain data (e.g., from CSV files) flows through Azure services — starting from Blob Storage, processed by Data Factory, transformed in Synapse Analytics, and visualized in Power BI. The final dashboard offers insights into delays, inventory, and costs for improved decision-making.
> The architecture includes:
> - Azure Blob Storage for raw data upload  
> - Google Colab for ETL and predictive modeling  
> - Power BI for data visualization  
> - GitHub for version control and collaboration
