## 🚀 **Project Overview**

This project showcases a **real-world supply chain analytics system** built entirely with **free tools** (Google Colab + Power BI + GitHub) while **simulating Azure Cloud architecture**.  
It provides complete **visibility**, **predictive insights**, and **performance analytics** — all ready for direct migration to Azure services.

🎯 **Goal:** Demonstrate how powerful cloud-inspired architectures can be built cost-free — ideal for students, analysts, and cloud architects.

---

## 🧩 **Why This Project Matters**

This project bridges that gap by:

✅ Creating a **single source of truth** for orders, shipments, and suppliers  
✅ Predicting **shipment delays** and **demand fluctuations**  
✅ Providing **real-time dashboards** for smarter decision making  
✅ Using **Azure-equivalent architecture** with 100% free tools

## 🧩 Architecture Diagram

![Azure Architecture Diagram](Architecture/AzureArchitecture_SupplyChain.png)

*Figure: Azure Data Architecture for Supply Chain Visibility*

This diagram illustrates how raw supply chain data (e.g., from CSV files) flows through Azure services — starting from Blob Storage, processed by Data Factory, transformed in Synapse Analytics, and visualized in Power BI. The final dashboard offers insights into delays, inventory, and costs for improved decision-making.
> The architecture includes:
> - Azure Blob Storage for raw data upload  
> - Google Colab for ETL and predictive modeling  
> - Power BI for data visualization  
> - GitHub for version control and collaboration

✨ Each page uses **DAX measures**, **cross-filtering**, and **tooltip insights** for interaction.

---

## 📈 EDA Insights

- **Shipping Methods**: Standard Class had the highest delay rate.
- **Customer Segment**: Home Office segment was under-utilized.
- **Monthly Demand Trends**: Seasonal fluctuations in orders.
- **Correlations**: Delay tied to long-distance + standard shipping.
- **Forecast Tooltip**: Forecasted 3 months demand using Decision Tree Classifier.

### 📊 Power BI Dashboard Overview  
#### 🧭 **1. Overview Page**
KPI cards show *Total Orders*, *On-Time %*, and *Average Delay*.  
Visuals update dynamically by region, date, and shipment status.

#### ⚙️ **2. Operations Page**
Tracks active shipments, late orders, and performance across transport modes.  
Includes **risk alerts** (highlighted via DAX measures).

#### 🏢 **3. Suppliers Page**
Ranks suppliers by *on-time delivery rate*, *delay days*, and *fulfillment volume*.  
Uses conditional formatting to flag underperformers.

#### 🛰️ **4. Live Tracking Page**
Simulates a **control-tower view** with real-time shipment status.  
Interactive “In-Transit”, “Processing”, and “Delivered” filters with hover effects.

#### 🔮 **5. Forecast Page**
Compares **actual vs predicted demand** using machine learning models.  
Shows performance metrics: **RMSE**, **MAE**, and **R²**.

---

### 🧮 Key DAX Highlights  
```DAX
Late Flag =
VAR diff = DATEDIFF(Shipments[ShipDate], Shipments[DeliveredDate], DAY)
RETURN IF(diff > 0, 1, 0)

On-Time % =
VAR ontime = CALCULATE([Total Shipments], FILTER(Shipments, [Late Flag] = 0))
RETURN DIVIDE(ontime, [Total Shipments])

Risk Alert =
VAR lateRate = CALCULATE(AVERAGE([Late Flag]), ALLEXCEPT(Shipments, Shipments[Route]))
RETURN IF(lateRate > 0.2, "⚠️ High", "✅ Normal")
